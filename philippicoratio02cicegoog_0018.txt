Fulvia Antony had married as bis third wife. He declared that no
exemptione from tribute had been granted to any cities. He con·
sented to the proposal of Sulpicius that no further ‘acts' of Caesar
should be ratified His popularity culminated when he proposed that
de office of dictator should be abolisbed for ever. ln the beginning
of April he did good service to the state by crusbinga distrubance
raised by one Herophilus, who pretended to be a grandson of Marius,
and whom he put to death withouta trial (r. a, 5). Emboldened by
his success, he began to make unscrupulous use of Caesar's papers,
urging tbe pleasure of the dictator for every measure or appointment
which might suit his purpose, and not hesitating to forge supposititious
memoranda, when no convenient documenta could be found among the
genuine ‘acta Caesaris! In addition to the favour which be thus acquired,

Atia toremrn to Rome at once, he crossed the sea without delay, and land·
ing near Lupiae in Calabria, he remained there till the receipt of a copy
of Caesar's will emboldened him to advance to Brundisium, and present
hbnself to the garrison in that place as C. Iulius Caesar Octavianus,
the dictator's adopted son He was warmly received by the veterana,
and encouraged to send a formal notification of his claims to the senate
and the leaders of the two parties. Following this up by a cautious
advance towards Rome, at Naples he met Cicero, who gladly welcomed
