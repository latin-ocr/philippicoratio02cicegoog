INTRODUCTION

TO THE THIRTEENTH ORATION.

Snonrar after Pansa had left Rome, in the middle ol March, to J'oin
his colleague before Mutina, letters arrived from L. Plancus, the governor
of Transalpine Gaul, and Consul elect, and from M. Lepidus, now in
command of the province of Hither Spain. They both strongly advo·
cated peace with Antony, and both at the same time wrote to Cicero,
declaring their unswerving loyalty to the senate, Lepidus in vague and
general terms, Plancus with apologies for past hesitation, and assurances
of energetic action sor the future. (Cic. Fam. 10. 34 and 353 ib. 7

audii.) Ι

The despatch of Plancus was first laid before the senate, and after a
two days’ debate, in the course of which Cicero delivered two speeches
which are not preserved, a vote of manis tobim was passed on Cicero's
proposal. On the following day P. Servilius proposed a vote of thanis
to Lepidus, coupiing with it arecommendation to him to leave the
question of peace to the senate, who could not entertain it until Antony
laid‘down his arms. On this occasion 'Cicero delivered bis thirteenth
oration, in which he supports the motion of Servilius, especially depre-
cating peace witb Antony. In addition to the reasons previously urged,
he laid before the senate a letter reoently addressed by Antony to Hirtius
and Pansa, which he criticises, clause by clause, with a bitterness and
animosity not surpassed in any of the other orations.

He concludes by adding to the motion of Servilius a vote of thanks to
Sextus Pompeius, for his promises of aid to the senate and the Roman

people.
