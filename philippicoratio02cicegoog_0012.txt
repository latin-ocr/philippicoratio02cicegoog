PREFACE.

HavtNG been esked by the Delegates ol the Clarendon Press to
undertake the editing ola portion ol Cicero's orations, 1 was induced
to choose the series delivered against Antony, partly from finding that
as a matter ol lact they had become to be more read by Students in
this University than any other portion of his works; but even more

most strongly Cicero's power as an orator, and his importance in the ·

State at what was perhaps really the most honourable portion ol his ,
lile, and also es illustrating a period os history concerning which we
hare so little contemporary information. From these consideratione
Ihad l'or some years past selected them as a subiect for lectores with
my own pupils; my experience in which both laid the foundation ol
this edition and convinced me that some new commentary was required.
Indeed the Philippic orations ol Cicero appear oi late years to have
sunh into an obscurity which contrasts strongly with the high esteem
in which they were held by ancient writers, and the attention which
was paid to them by early commentatore. For more than lorty years
no separate edition oi them, with explanatory notes, has been published
either in Englend or on the continent ; and the only English corn-
mentary on the whole series which has appeared is that'ol Mr. Long‚
which embraces all the orations of Cicero. The first and second
orations bave been cerehrlly edited‚ with short German notes, by Karl
Halm, the colleague ol J. G. Baiter in completing the second edition
ol Orelli's text ol the whole works ol Cicero ; and Halm's notes
on the second oration have been translated and expanded. with his
usual exhaustive caresrdness‚ by Mr. J. E. B. Mayor. From the notes
in Halm's edition 1 have derived much assistance, and to Mr. Mayor‘s
additional notes l have been occasionally indebted for uselul informa-
non.
