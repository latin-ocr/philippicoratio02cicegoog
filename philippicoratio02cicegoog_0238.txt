ΤΟ THE TENTH ORATION.

Aaoun the sarne time that M. Antonius left Rome, his brother
C. Antonius started for Macedonia, to take possession of that province.
The government of it for the year 43 B.C. had been originally assigned
by Caesar to M. Brutus; it had been transferred by a decree of the
senate on the 5th of June to M. Antonius3 when he obtained from the
people, probably in July, the province of Cisalpine Gaul, it had been
transferred, in the general allotment of the provinces, to his brother Gaius,
and lastly‚ on the aoth of December, this allotment had been annulled
on the motion of Cicero, and a decree passed that the provinces should
remain in the hands of their present governors till successors should be
appointed hythe senate. With this complication it was no wonder that
the possession of the province should be disputed. The best title was
perhaps that of M. Antonius, and Cicero himself aelnowledges that it
was valid (see on 11.12, 27); but he had abandoned his claim iu his
attempta upon Cisalpine Gaul; and the contest remained between the
two other claimants M. Bmtus, who had gone to Athens in September,
end had there received a large supply of money from the quaestor
M. Apuleius, and been joined by the remnants of the forces of Pompey,
vas the first in the field, and was aclnowledged by Q. Hortensius, the
son of the orator, whom he found in command of the province, ss his
legitimate successor. Being thus placed at the head of the regular forces
in the province, he was enabled to set C. Antonius at defiance, and force
him to take refuge in Apollonia, where he lrept him closely shut up. He
was also warmly supported hythe troops of P. Vatinius, who was pro-
consul in Illyricum, though it is doubtful how far this was by the will of
Vatinius himself. (Compare ro. 6, 13 with Livy Epit. 118 and Veli Pat.
