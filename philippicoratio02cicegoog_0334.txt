To THE FOURTEENTH ORA TION. 319

duae, signa sexaginta sunt relata Antonii. Res bene gesta est A. d.
xii. Kalendas Maias, ex castris! ⁸

The despatch of Hirtius excited to the highest pitch the enthusiasm of
the people, already roused in Cicero’s favour by the speech of Apuleius.
They crowded to his house, and conducted him in a triumphal proces-
sion to the Capitol, and back again to his home on the Palatine. This
was on the aoth of April, the day on which Galba’s letter was written,
and on me following day, M. Cornutus, the city praetor, calle'd a meeting
of the senate. It was moved by P. Servilius that the citizens should lay
aside the military garb, and that a public thanksgiving should be
celebrated in honour of the victory. Cicero followed with the fourteenth
and last extant Philippic oration. In respect to the first point he urged
that it would be premature to lay aside the garb of war till the siege of
Mutina was actually raised; but the second motion he eagerly supported
as implying more than it expressed. On no previous occasion had a
thanlrsgiving been decreed for avictory over citizens, and therefore in
voting for its celebration now, the senate really was pronouncing Antony
a public enemy. He accordingly moved that the time should be
extended to me unprecedented length of fisty days, and that the three
generals, Hirtius, Pansa,¹ and Octavianus, should be included in the
honour; though even according to his own account, Octavianus had
taken no part in the actual battle. He concluded with a glowing eulogy
of those who had fallen in the battle, consoling their surviving friends
with the thoughts of the glory which they had won, and which would be
made imperishable by the public monument which he proposed should
be erected to their memory.

It is probable that Cicero delivered hrrther orations on the subject of
the contest with Antony, and we might especially expect to lind one on
the occasion of the second battle before Mutina, in which Hirtius was
killed and Antony decisively defeated; but there is no trace of any
later speech preserved, except two short fragments quoted by Arusianus
(p. 225, Lindem.) as from a sixteenth Philippic oration.

For this oration Halm obtained the collation of an additional MS,
but without any valuable results, as it has given rise to no improvement
in the text, and appears to be carelessly written. 11 is in the Vatican
library, and is pronounced by Halm (who quotes it as ‘v.’) to be ‘ex
venustioribus Italicis!
