242 INTRODUCJION TO IHE ELEVENTH oRA Tlos:

originally been assigned, and who was already there, in arms against Ι

Dolabella He aclmowledges that Cassius was acting against the orders

of the senate, but urges that he was really furthering the true interests ol

the state with energy and judgment; and that in acrisis like the present
such patriotism should be encouraged without presslng too closely the y
letter os the law. The speech, which opens with aviolent tirade against
Dolabella, was unsuccesslul, mainly through the influence os Pansa; and

it was agreed, on the motion ol Q. Fufius Calenus, to commit the charge

ol the two provinces to the Consuls, so soon as they should have ended

the campaign against Antony. (Fam. ra. 7, 1.) Cassius however, as
Cicero had predicted, took the law into his own hands, and assuming ¹
the government ol Syria, shortly allerwards reduced Laodicea, into ,
which Dolabella had thrown himself ; aod Dolabella, to escape falling 2
into his hands, committed suicide. The text ol' this speech is in a less ,
satisfactory state than that oi the preceding ones, the Vatican MS. falling

in the middle of the ninth chapter, and theneesorth only supplying us with ,
fragments os the twelsth and thirtoeuth orations, containing ra. 5, ιη- ζ
ra. 9, ²33 and 13. ι, r;-13. 5, ro.
