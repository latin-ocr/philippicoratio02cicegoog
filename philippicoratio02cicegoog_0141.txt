INTRODUCTION

TO THE FOURTH ORATION.

Tnn senate having passed a decree in accordante with the terms ol'
the resolution proposed by Cicer0, he proceeded immediately to the
Fonnn, and announced to the people, at the suggestion ol M. Servilius,
and the other tribunes ol the commone, the determination to which the
senate had come; showing that though Antony was not yet declared an
enemy to the state, yet that the senate, by the mensures they had taken,
were practically acting on the supposition ol his treason. The speech,
delivered in the excitement ol the moment, is naturally less linished than
those which he had carehdly prepared, and in many parts contains a
repetition, less happily expressed, of ideas on which he had enlnrged
before the senate.

The genuineness oi the oration has been osten questioned, especially
by F. G. Jentaen‚ in a pamphlet published at Lubeck in 1820, and hy
Α. Krause, in an address delivered at Neu Stettin in 1847. The argu-
ments ol the former call lor the less consideration, because they are
based on the theory that Cicero only published any ol his orations lot
one ol two reasons; either to gratily some client whose cause he had
pleaded‚ or because he thought them likely to prove useiul to the youth
ol Rome, as models ol oratory. He entirely ignores the historioal
interest which by itsell would justily the publication ol a speech lile
this, and is naturally led by his hypothesis to criticise details ii the
oration with a severity that makes no allowance for the circumstances
under which it was delivered. .

Krause attacks it on grounds both ol external and internal evidence.
The sonner he aclrnowledges to be partly on the other side, since the
end os the third chapter is quoted both by Quintilian (9. 3, 86) and by
the Spanlsh grammarian isidorus (Orig. a. ar, rr); while the words
‘Incumbite in causam’ (c. 5, ra) are quoted by Arusianus Messius.
