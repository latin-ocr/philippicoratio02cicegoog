ΤΟ THE FIRSY ORA TION. 5

hntony had summoned the senate for the following day. Cicero, after
me hesitation, resolved not to attend, plending fatiguc and sickness
to the Consuls, while to his friends he urged the impossibility of his
appuling as a witness of the honours which were to be proposed to
Cassan His real reason appears to have been an unwillingness to tnke

the initiative in the contest between himself and Antony which was now
inevitahle. ln his absence the Consul uttered the most violent invective
against him, upbraiding him with cowardice in steying away, and even
thmtening the demolition of his house. He then retired to his villa
at Tium bnt Dolabella summoned the senate to meet on the following
day in the temple of Concord‚ when Cicero delivered his first Philippis
onnon against Antony. The tone of it is moderate, compared with
that of those which follow. He seeum unwilling to close every door
of pesce between himself and his antagonist3 and though he attechs his
public policy unsparingly‚ be abstains as yet from any personal abuse,
siches is conspicuous in all the rest of these orations.
