paying assiduous court to the individual senators, and by undertaking
to pay the bequests of Caesar to the people. Antony was absent from
Rome, but hearing of Octavius' growing popularity, he hastened bacll
to the city, and about the middle of the month he had an interview with
Octavius, in which the latter claimed the money of the dictator which
Antony had appropriated Antony refused to refund it on the
ground that it was public treasure, when Octavius took upon himself
the payment of the legacies, as well as the exhibition of shows at the
dedication of the temple which Caesar had built in honour of venus
Genitrix. ·
Meanwhile M. Brutus and Cassius had retired from the city to Lanu·
vium probably at the dme of the disturbances caused by the Pseudo-¹

This news changed his plaus once more; he resolved to go at once
