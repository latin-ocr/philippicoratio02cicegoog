INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH ORATION. 127

Agvinst this testimony he brings the fact that Nonius (p. 373) quotes, as
from the fourth Philippic, the words ‘si cum fascibus clam te ex urbe
proieceris* which do not occur in the oration as we have it, and which be
says are specially appropriate, as supplying a natural allusion to Antony's
ssight He also thinks that the words ‘Laudat an compellat edicto:

, quoted by Acron (on Hor. S. a, 3, 297) as from the Philippies,

probably belonged to the genuine fourth Philippic. Now, even granung
thc accuracy' of Nonius, it is a less violent supposition to allow that the
words which be quotes may bave dropped out from the oration, than to
condemn it altogether ; and the supposition that Acron, if quoting
correctly, is quoting bom the fourth oration, is entirely gratuitous,
especially as we know that at least one of this series of orations is
l lost
l His internal evidence is of two kinds, from the subject-maner, and
from details in the language of the speech. The first is mainly negative,
from the absence of certain topica which be thinks that Cicero must
bave introduced. He observes that he does not mention in detail the

⁹ several points of the senate's decree; that there is no mention of the

ssight of Antony from the city; that there is no defense of Octavianus,
whose conduct was technically illegal; and that there is no abuse of the
brothers of Antony. Now, in the first place, the whole of this argument
rests on the assumption that because Cicero might naturally bave iutro·
(luced these topics in his speech, therefore he must necessarily have
done so, which is at once illogical and arbitrary; and even in detail,

Ἰ most of the positione fail. In the senate, Cicero was giving his formal

vote on the matters before the house, and therefore necessarily men-
tioned every separate clause in the resolutioris be supported; but some

² of them were comparatively unitnportant‚ as the decrce that tbe provinces
l should remain in the power of the existing magistrates3 and to one

at any rate, that the tn'bunes should provide for the safe meeting of
the senate on the 1st of January, Cicero was in his beart opposed,
because it interfered with his wisb for immediate action. (See Phil.
. 3.1, 1; and cp. Drnmann‚ Geschicht. Rom. 1. 224 notes 95 and 96.)
,“’ The second point, the llight of Antony, we have already seen, was
¹ possibly mentioned, if we believe the fragment quoted by Nonius
to have belonged to this oration. The second chapter of the speech,
with its panegyric on Octavianus, would surely be sufficient apology

, for his conduct before an audience whose passione Cicero was suiving

to excite, rather than to convince their minda. As for tbe omission

' of any invective against the other brothers, the want of it seems

ratberto arise from an overstrained interpretation of the word ‘ semper'
