INTRODUCTION TO THE EIGHTH ORATION. 193

ground that Antony was his nephew. However he was supported by
Q. Fufius Calenus, and some others, and eventually by the Consul
himself. lt is not easy to understand why Cicero took no prominent
part in the debate (see however on c. ι, 1), but allowed the proposal of
L. Caesar to be carried, though it was strongly in opposition to his own

· desires. On the following day, the senate having met again to consider
further measures, he delivered the eighth oration, in which he criticizes ’
severely both the proceedings of the senate on the previous day, and the
pusillanimous conduct of the ambassadors in allowing such contemptuous -
insolence on the part 'of Antony. He protests against any half measures,
'urging that Antony could only be treated as an enemy to whom no
tenns could be granted; and that to send a second embassy to him was
only to incure second time the degradation which the first had brought
upon them ; and he concludes by proposing that Cotyla, the envoy sent
by Antony, should at once be ordered to return to him, and that an
amnesty should be granted to all of Antony's soldiers who should leave
his standard before the Ides of March.
