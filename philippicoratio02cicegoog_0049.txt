34 INHfODUCTION TO THE SECOND ORATION.

declared himself his enemy, and laid bare his character in one of the
bitterest invectives which has ever been composed. He begins by
answering in detail the charges which hutony had brought against him,
and then reviews the public and the private life of Antony throughout
its course, showing him to be, ifthe account be true, the greatest
monster of corruption, meauness, and profligacy ever seen upon the
earth. Even allowing for exaggeration, there was enough 01 truth in
the attaclr to maleit tell with fatal force against the cause of Antony.
The people were chalcen by it in their natural allegiance to the Consrrl ;
the veterans were reminded that the man who claimed to be the heir
of Caesar’s power had slighted and insulted Caesar's adopted son; and
the senate were roused to energetic measures against Antouy which
contrasted strongly with their previous apathy. Above all, Cicero was
placed in a position of influenoe which made him virtually the leader
of the senate, and gave additional weight to his continued exertions
in the cause of ireedom.

The speech professes to be spoken ou the roth of September, in
immediate reply to Antony 3 but even from interual evidence, from the
elaboration of its arguments, and the very perfectuess of its detail, we
might guther that it could not have been au extempore address; and
it is at least noticeable that in no speech which he actually delivered
does he lavish such unqualified abuse upon the tyranny 01 Caesar.

Though it is characteriaed in many parts bya coarseness which we feel
to be intolerable to modern ears, yet the verdict of all ages prouounces
this oration to be Cicero'sm-asterpiece„ It is probably to this, the
longest of the politicsl orations, that the younger Pliny is referring,
Ep. r. 3ο, 4, when he tells 01 ⁴M. Tullium, 33133 oratio optima fertur,
quae maxima ;' and the lines of Juvenal, 10. 124, are famous

Ι1113133313 poenum malo,
Qam te mnrpicuae, 311νί33 Philippica, famae,
Volven'e a prirna quae proxima!
lt was undoubtedly to this oration that the title of Philippic was
especially applied, though when it was first given is not easily ascertained.
Plutarch, Cic. 34, says that Cicero himself entitled the orations his
Philippics, but he is perhaps referring to passages in the spurious letters
to Brutus, 3. 4, 2 ; 5, 43 so that the lines of Juvenal contain the first
certain trace of the name.
The oration has great historical, as well as literary, value, from the
continual allusions to the events 01 3 period 01 which we baveno
satisfactory continuous history.
