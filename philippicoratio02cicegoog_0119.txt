his enemies for plunder. He convened the senate for the 34111 01
November, denouncing any senator who should absent himself as 311
enemy ιο him 3ηάιο his country. On the appointed day he was
himself absent, being, according to Cicero (Phil. 3. 8, 30), too dmnk to
maire bis appearance He summoned another meeting in the Capitol
for the atith, at which he forbade three tribunes, whom he knew to be
hostile to him, to be presept.

The object of the meeting was to denounce the conduct of Octavi·
anus, but when the day arrived his resolution failed him, 3ηά the only
proposai laid before the senate was fora ‘supplicatio‘ ιιι honour of
Μ. Lepidus. 111 the midst of the debate οιι this, a message reached
him that the fourth legion had openly deciared in favour of Octavianus
11ηά joined the Martia, which had already taken up a position at Alba.
Feeling that to stay in Rome was dangerous, he tooir a hurried division

On the other hand he highly extois the conduct of Octavianus, of Decimus
Brutus, and the fourth and Martianle' e;0ns and be ends his speech by
formaily proposing that the thanirs ο the senate should be given them
for what they had done, and that the recent changes' 111 the disposition
of the provinces should be annuiied. His proposaIs were accepted by
