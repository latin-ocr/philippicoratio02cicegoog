TO THE FOURTEENTH ORATION.

Arrun the departure of Pansa to J'oin his colleague, Cicero was lest
practically at the head of affairs in Rome, and about the middle of April
his opponente took advantage of his prominence to spread a rumour
that he was intending to assume the dictatorship. Their design was
favoured bya report which reached the city at the same time that Antony
had gained a great victory, and was marching upon Rome: and Cicero
would have been in considerable danger, had not P. Apuleius, the
tribune of the commons, corne forward to vindicate the purity of his
policy, and expose the absurdity of the rumour which was circulated of
his ambition. Very shortly aiter this speech was delivered, a despatch
arrived from Hirtius with the news of a victory over Antony, and the
tide immediately turned in Cicero’s favour. It appears that Antony had
evacuated Bononia, in order to concentrate his forces before Mutina, so
that Pansa advanced without opposition to within eight miles of the
latter city. There he was opposed by Antony with two legions, two
praetorian cohorts, and some veteran volunteers. Hirtius however sent
a detachment to his aid, and the result was a decided success on the
part of the Consuls, though Pansa was seriously, and, as it turned out,
mortally wounded in the engagement. The details oi the battle may be
best given in the words of Ser. Sulpicius Galba (Cic. Fam. ro. 30), who
held a command in Pansa's army. His narrative slightly differs from
that of Appian, and also in some small particulars from the account in
Cicero’s speech; but Appian is not quite impartial in his history of these
times, and Cicero spolre the fourteenth oration before the arrival oi
Galba's letter, and probably with imperfect information as to the details
of the battle, so that, considering the clearness and vigour of Galba's
account, ,and the opportunity which he possessed of knowing the par-
ticulare, 'we may fairly trust its accuracy. He says: Ἀ. d. xvii. Kalend.
