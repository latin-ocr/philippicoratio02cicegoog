224 INTRODUCTION 70 THE ΤΕΝΤΗ ORATION.

called a meeting oi the senate, and speaking os M. Brutus in the highest
terms, laid before them the question whether he should be confirmed in
the govemment which he had assumed. Q. Fufius Calenus, who opened

the debate, proposed that he should be removed from his command; and ’

it was in answer to him that Cicero delivered his tenth oration It is

mainly a warm panegyricon the conduct oi M. Brutus The two main s

objections to be urged against him were that he had no more right in
Macedonia than Antonius, and that ii one os caesam murderers vvere
supported the veterans vortld take offence. The first point Cicero passes
overas lightly as possible, maintaining that even il he were not borne
out by the letter of the law. yet in all that he had done he had anticipsted
the wishes of the senate, and been actuated by a spirit oi the purest
patriotism: so that no loyal citizen could hesitate to preier him to
Antonius. With regard to the second point he declares that the veterans
had shown themselves superior to such prejudces, when they interiered
with the weliare oi the state; and indignantly protests against the idea
oi submitting the highest interests oi the commonwealth to the vill and
pleasure oi the soldiery.

He concludes by formally proposing that M. Bmtus should be con-

firmed in the government oi the province, and that he should be supplied Ὗ

with all the requisites sor carrying on the campaign. His motion was
agreed to by the senate. The exact date oi the speech cannot be ascer-
tained, but it was probably delivered about the beginning oi March,
43 B.C.
