INTRODUCTION

ΤΟ ΤΗΕ ΝΙΝΤΗ ORATION.

Snonrnr after the delivery of the eighth oration, another meeting of
the senate was held, to consider what honours should be paid to the
memory of Servius Sulpicius, who had died on the embassy to Antony.
He had been chosen as ambassador on account of his eminence asa
jurist‚ and his high reputation for uprightness of character; and Cicero
is probably guilty of no exaggeration in pronouncing him the mainstay
of the expedition. He had been in very bad health before he started,
and was anxious to decline the commissioni, but yielded to the pressure
put on him by the senate, so that Cicero had some foundation for saying
that the senate were responsible for his death. The Consul, Pansa,
proposed that he should be honoured with a public funeral, and a gilt
pedestrian statue placed in the Rostra; and it was in support of this
motion that Cicero delivered his ninth Philippic oration. He says that

’ he need have spoken a very few words, had not P. Servilius opposed the

latter part of the deeree, on the ground that a statue had never before
been voted to any ambassador, unless he had been slain by violence on
his embassy. Cicero urges that Sulpicius even more truly gave his life
for his country than any who had been so put to death, sirice he lmew

= before he started that he had small chance of returnlng. He points out
· how fully worthy Sulpicius had proved himself of such honours, and how

the form of them was most appropriate to the man. The motion of the
Consul was carried in its integrity, and a statue was erected before the
Rostra, which was still standing in the time of Aurelian, as a testimony
to the fame of Sulpicius and the eloquence of Cicero. .

The speech is one of the most genial and pleasing which we have of

a Cicero's: it displays genuine feeling for the loss of a friend, and in the

wann panegyric which he utters over the illustrious jurist, he forgets lor
