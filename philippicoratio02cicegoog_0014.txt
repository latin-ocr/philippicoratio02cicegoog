MSS.

01 these the Vatican (commonly quoted as V) is the most important.
lt is preserved in the archives 01 100 Basilica 01 81. Peter at Rome,
andis commonly referred to the eighth or nintb century. 11 was first
colated by Gabriel Faerni in 1561, subsequently by Muretus and
Garatonius, and more recentlya special collation was made 101 Halm's
large edition.

Four ntSS, commonly quoted collectively as D, individually as abgt, ’
bold the next place. They are of different dates, a and bbelonging to
the thirteenth, t to the eleventh century; but they are all manifestly
derived t'rom the same older MS, while their discrepancies show them
to be independent copies: band t are the most carehrlly written of the
lour. Tbey are preserved at Bamberg, Beme, Wollenbtlttel, and
Tegemsee respectively.

An Italian MS. 01 the fifteenth century, now in a private libmry
ln Ireland, has been used by Halm in parts where either the Vatican
or the other MSS. have sailed. lt is quoted by him as i.

For the lourteenth oration he also consulted an old Italian MS,

quoted as v in the Vatican library; but it is apparently 01 very
inferior authority.
