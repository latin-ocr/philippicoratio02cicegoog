INTRODUCTION

ro THE Turno owarrom

Tan third oration brings before us a new scene in the struggle
between the different parties in the state, and is directed against an
attempt on the part of Antony which gave occasion, more or less
directly, to all the remaining orations except tbe eleventh. We bave seen
that one of the first mensures which Antony proposed, after the death of
Caesar, was a change in the disposition of the provinces, whereby he
was to obtain Macedonia, and Dolabella Syria. Not content with this,
he shortly afterwards, probably in July (see Merivale 3. 98), proposed
that Macedonia should be transferred to his brother Caius, and that he
himself should supplent Decimus Brutus in Cisalpine Gaul, apparently
with the object of remaining in command of a powerful force within
easy reacb of the city. The senate refused to listen to the proposal,
but Antony brought it before the people in the ‘comitia' and gained
their assent by persuading them that Decimus was preparing to attach
the party of Caesar, and uphold the cause of bis assassins by force of
arms, He also obtained leave to recall four legions from Macedonia,
and on the oth of October proceeded to Brundisium to place himself at
their head On his way he put some soldiers to death at Suessa
Aumncorum‚ and finding at Brundisium that two of the legions, the
Martia and Quarta, despised the largess which he offered them, he
treacherously massacred their centurione in the presence of his wife.
Finding that the troops were not to be depended on, probably owing to
the temptations offered by agents of Octavianus, he sent the second and
thirty-fifth legions, which still in the main adhered to him, (see 5. 19, 533
Fam. ro. go, ι), in detachments towards Cisalpine Gaul, appointing a
rendezvous at Ariminum3 and returned himself to Rome, at the head
of the Gauiish legion Alauda, which he had probably brought with
him from Rome; as we know that it was there in the earlier part of
the summer (Ate. 16. 8, a).

Octavianus had meanwhile been levying troops, and winning over the
veterans in Campania, by a largess of 500 denarii apiece. By Cicero's
advice he returned to Rome, shortly before the arrival of Antony, but
finding that the veterana were not yet prepared for open conflict with
the Consul, he thought it prudent to retire to Arretium.

Antony tert the bulk of his troops at Tibur, but entered the city,
contraryto the laws, at the head of an armed force, to whom, as he
marched through the streets, he promised the houses and property of
