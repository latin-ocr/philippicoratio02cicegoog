lNTRODUCTlON

TO THE SlXTH ORATION.

Ar the close ol the debate in the senate which gave rise to the hsth'
Philippis oration, Cicero carne out into the Forum, on the 4th os January‚
and being introduced to the multitude by P. Apuleius, a tribune ol the
commons‚ he told thern in the sixth oration what had happened.

In it he shows again the absurdity and danger ol sending ambassadors
to Antony, and so delaying the declaration os war against him; which
he declares to be inevitable‚ lrom considerations ol the character both
of Antony himself, and oi his chief companions‚ especially his brother
Lucius; and hc concludes by urging thern to await patiently the return
of the ambassadors, and to let nothing induce thern to woverin the finn

assertion ol their liberty, which he had ever laboured to support.
