138 INTRODUCTION TO THE FIFTH ORATION.

representative in Rome, and Fulvia and her children were actually staying
at his house. He proposed that antony should not yet be treated as a
public enemy, but that ambassadors should be sent to him, to bring him
back, if possible, to his allegiance to the senate. This motion was
supported by L. Piso and some other consulars, and it was against it
that Cicero delivered his fifih oration.

In it he urges that it would be in the ¹highest degree inconsistent, and
unworthy of the dignity of the senate to enter into negotiatione with a
man whom, a few days before, they had virtually declared to be a public
enemy, by voting their thanks to the legions who had deserted him, and
to the generals who had taken on themselves to act against him. He
pasees in review once more the conduct of Antony since the dictators
death3 his wanton forgeries; his various pemicious measures, especially
condemning his degradation oi the judicial bench; and his uncon-
stitutional conduct in maintaining an armed force within the city walls.
He maintains that not merely war, but civil war (tamum) should be
proclaimed, that the military dress should be assumed, the courts of
justice closed, and a general levy made throughout the whole of Italy.
He concludes by renewing his proposal of thanks and honours to
D. Brutus and Octavianus, and the soldiers under their command.

The debate was continued for the unusual period of four days, and it
appears that Cicero would have had a large majority, had not Salvius, a
tribune of the commons, interposed his veto, and prevented the motion
for declaring Antony a public enemy from being voted on. The
proposal of Calenus was then adopted; Servius Sulpicius L. Piso
and ·L. Philippus were appointed ambassadors to treat with Antony ; and
Cicero so far prevailed that he was entrusted with the drawing out of
their commission. They were instructed to call on Antony to raiae the
siege of Mutina, to ceaae from further hostilities against D. Brutus,
and from all attempta upon the province of Cisalpine Gaul, and to
submit himself in all respects to the authority of the senate and the
Roman people. If he refused submission on any single point, he was
to be treated as a public enemy.

The rest of the proposals in Cicero's motion, with reference to the
honours to be bestowed on Brutus and Octavianm and their armies,
were carried without opposition.
