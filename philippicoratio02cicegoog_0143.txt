128 INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH ORATION.

in 12. 7, ry (‘in totam denique M. Antonii domum sum semper
invectus’) which is surely sufficiently justified hythe abuse lavished on
them in the third, sixth, seventh, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth orations.

The only positive argument that Krause hripgs against the speech
from the subject-matter is that it so often coincides with that oi the third
oration; to which he adds (and in this he follows in the steps ol
Jentaen), that in many cases the very expressions are horrowed, but
spoiled hy being differently turned, srom passages in the former speech.
These characteristics, however, are just what might be looked sor in a
case where a man had delivered a carefully prepared speech in a body
like the senate, and then proceeded to address a popular assembly on
the same subject. The seme ideas would occur to his mind, and the
old phrases would adapt themselves to those ideas, while want of full
preparation, with perhaps less carefulness in addressing a less educated
audience, would tend to divest those phrases os their exact propriety ol'
expression. It we maydrsw any inference from the laets alleged, it
should rather be that we have here the speech as Cicero actually
delivered it, not retouched and polished at his leisure.

The individual passages which Jentzen and Krause severally select, as
evidence ol spuriousness, will be more convenientiy considered in the
notes as they occur.
