198 M. TULLII CICERONIS uus-4.

legum, quas pervim consul Sulla latas esse dicebut3 Cinna cum
Octavio de novorum civium suffragiis, rursus cum Mario et
Carbone Sulla, ne dominarentur indigni ct ut clarissimorum ho-
minum crudelissimam poenitetur necem. Horum omnium bel-
elomm causae err rei publicae contentione natae sunt. De proximo
bello civili uon libet dicere: ignoro causans, detestor exitum.
Hoc bellum quintum civile geritur—atque omnia in nostramet
aetatem inciderunt-primum non modo uon in dissensione et s
discordia civium, scd in maxima consensione incredibilique con·
socordia. Omnes idem volunt, idem defenduut, idem sentiunt.
Cum omnes dico, eos excipio, quos nemo civitate dignos putat.
Qae est igitur in medio belli causa posita? Nos deorum im-
mortalium templa, uos muros, nos domicilia sedesque populi ‹
Romani, aras, focos, sepulchra maiorum, nos leges, iudicia,
15libertatem, coniuges, liberos, patriam defendimus: contra M. Au-
tonius id molitur, id pugnat, ut haec omnia perturbet, evertat,
praedam rei publicae causam belli putet, fominus nostras purtim

dissipet, partim dispertiat parricidis.
