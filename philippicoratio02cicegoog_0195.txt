INTRODUCTION

TO THE SEVENTH ORATION.

nunno the absence oi the ambassadors the Consuis summoned a

meeting oi the senate, ior the purpose of settiing sonte comparatively ,

unimportant business connected with the Appian road, the Mint, and
the festival of the Lupercalia. The day of the meeting is not exactly
known, but it was before the r5th of February, that being the day on
which the Lupercalia were held. Cicero was present, and on being asked
sor his vote upon the first two questions, he took the opportunity oi

delivering the seventh Philippic oration, in which the first three lines and ,

the lnst seven words refer to the matter under discussion, and the rest is

occupied with an urgent appeal to the senate not to listen to the friends ,

oi Antony, whose anxiety ior a peace, which was incompatible with
hecdom, saiety, or honour, showed more real ior the cause oi their
iriend than loyalty to their country. He therefore prcssed upon thern
the necessity os continuing their efforts ior the protection of the state,

since no sincere proposaIs could be hoped ior on the side of Ant'ony. t

The speech is one of his most eloquent: but it does not' appear that any
immediate aetion was taken in consequence of it.
