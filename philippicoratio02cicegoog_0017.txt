Carinae. To add ιο his security he filled the Eorum with troops, an
excuse for the precaution being afforded by the violence which the
mob had offered to the praetor, Cornelius Cinna, when he appeared?
among them' m his official robes. The result of a very stormy debate³
was a resolution that no investigation should be made into Caesar's
murder; but that all the ordinances and arrangements which he had
made,‘ acta Caesarisf should be ratified. This policy was supported
by Cicero, as ξι necessary compromise, and was acquiesced ιιι by
the liberators, though it was manifest that it left the whole power in
the hands of Antony. Apublic funeral was further decreed ιο Caesar,
on the motion of his father-in-law, L. Calpurnius Piso. These measures
were confirmed by the people, assembled in the Forum; and the
conspirators were invited to come down from the Capitol, Antony

sending his own son as a hostage for their security. On the following
day another meeting of the senate was held, and the distribution of
the provinces, as arranged by Caesar, was again confirmed. By this
assignment M. Brutus received Macedonia, and C. Cassius Syria,
though they could not properly enter into possession of them till
the expiration of their office of praetor. Decimus Bnrtus succeeded to
Cisalpine Gaul, Cimber to Bithynia, and Trebonius ιο Asia.

The next event was the funeral of Caesar, which Antony artfully
employed as a means of stirring up the fury of the people against his
murderers. Entitled, by his position as Consul, to pronounce the
funeral oration over his colleague, as the body lay in the Forum, pre·
viously ιο its being carried to the pyre prepared for it in the Campus
Martius, he roused their feelings by recounting the honours of the
dictator, which were reflected on the whole Roman people, and the
violated oath where‘by his murderers had swom to defend him. Ex-
cited to frenzy by his speech, and yet more by hearing the tenour of
Caesar's will, and his munificent bequests to the Roman people, the
crowd refused to allow the body to be removed without the city walls,
and burned ιι on a hastily raised pyre in the midst of the Forum
itself. The excitement rapidly spread. The houses of the liberators
were attaclred; Helvius Cinna, an adherent of Caesar, was torn in
pieces in mistalre for the praetor L. Cornelius Cinna, and the tumult
did not cease till the people were convinced that the principal con·
spirators had fled, and were for the present beyond their reach.

The advantage which Antony had gained by the course of events
at Caesare funeral he further secured by the moderation of his sub-
sequent conduct. He did not attempt to extend the amnesty to any
of the political exiles, with the single exception of Sextus Clodius, a,
