vi PREFACE.

The only other edition which has helped me much in the explanation
of the orations is that of Wemsdorf, which, though ill-arranged and
deficient in accuracy‚ is yet valuable as containing the notes of many
of the earlier commentators ; the most important being those of Abrami
on the first two orations. of Manutius, and of Garatonius. The last
of these do not appear to be preserved in any other form.

1 must gratefully aclrnovvledge the assistance which 1 have received
from Pr0fessor Conington, who looked over the sheets of this edition
as they passed through the prese, and improved it by many valuable
suggestions ; and also from the Rev. Α. Watson, of Brasenose College‚
who most kindly placed at my disposal his own notes on the orations.
These have been especially useful in illustrating the historical allusione.

The text is mainly taken frorn that of Halm, in the second edition
of Orelli's text. The deviatione from it are mostly in the direction
of a return to the authority of the Vatican MS, and are noted where
they occur; with the exception of a lew variatione from his orthography,
either for the sake of unifonnity‚ or in deference to the wishes of the
Delegates of the Press, that unusual mode of spelling should, so far
as possible, be avoided.

Besides the more usual historical and critical authorities, Ι have
gained considerable assistance from Mr. Forsyth's Life of Cicero; from
the recent excellent edition of the text of Cicero's works, by Baiter
and Kayser; and from various articles by Madvig, both as collected
in his Opuscula, and as scattered through the various German classical
periodicals. From these 1 have also gained some useful hints by other
scholare. The chronological Table of Cicero's life is founded on that
of Schtltz and Uster in Orelli's Onomasticon Tullianum. The grammars
of Madvig, Zumpt, and Donaldson 1 have quoted simply by their authors'

names.
Great pains have been taken to secure accuracy of reference. Every

quotation has been verilied‚ and the passages for the most part quoted
at length, sofar as they bore upon the point at issue. The references

to Cicero have been given both to the chapters and the smaller sections,
· but it should be noted that the smaller sections, except in the letters, ’
are a collateral, not 3 subordinate division, to the larger chapters.

Α list of the chief MSS. of these orations, and of the editions and
commentaries to which 1 have referred, is appended.
